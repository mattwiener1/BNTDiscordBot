# BNT Discord Bot

BNT Discord Bot is a Discord bot that listens for messages, responds using a ChatGPT service, and handles various commands. It is built using the Discord.NET library and features a modular command system.

## Description

This bot connects to a Discord server and listens for messages. When a message mentions the bot, it uses a ChatGPT service to generate a response and sends it back to the channel. The bot also handles various commands using a flexible and extensible command system. All received messages and events are logged for debugging purposes.

## Features

- **ChatGPT Integration**: Responds to mentions with AI-generated responses.
- **Modular Command System**: Easily extendable command handling using separate command classes.
- **Coin Flip**: Simulate a coin flip, returning "Heads" or "Tails".
- **Dice Roll**: Roll a die with a default of 20 sides or specify the number of sides.
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: Randomly returns "rock", "paper", or "scissors" when called.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mattwiener1/BNTDiscordBot.git
   cd BNTDiscordBot
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token.
   - `DISCORD_APP_ID`: Your Discord application ID.
   - `OPEN_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing the ChatGPT service.

3. **Build the project:**

   Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed, then run:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the bot:**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Interact with the bot:**

   - Mention the bot in a message on your Discord server to receive a response generated by the ChatGPT service.
   - Use the following commands:
     - `!flip`: Simulate a coin flip.
     - `!roll`: Roll a 20-sided die.
     - `!roll X`: Roll a die with X sides.
     - `!rps`: Get a random "rock", "paper", or "scissors" result.

## Project Structure

The project now follows a modular structure for better organization and easier maintenance:

- `DiscordBot.cs`: Main bot class that handles Discord events and command execution.
- `CommandHandler.cs`: Manages command registration and execution.
- `ICommand.cs`: Interface for standardizing command implementation.
- Individual command classes (e.g., `RollCommand.cs`, `FlipCommand.cs`, `RpsCommand.cs`): Implement specific bot commands.
- `ChatGPT.cs`: Handles integration with the ChatGPT service.
- Other utility classes (e.g., `CoinFlip.cs`, `Dice.cs`, `RockPaperScissors.cs`): Provide functionality for specific commands.

This structure makes it easy to add new commands by creating a new class that implements the `ICommand` interface and registering it in the `DiscordBot` constructor.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request for any improvements or bug fixes. When adding new commands, follow the existing structure by creating a new command class and registering it in the `DiscordBot` constructor.
