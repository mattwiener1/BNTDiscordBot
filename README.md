# BNT Discord Bot

BNT Discord Bot is a Discord bot that listens for messages and responds using a ChatGPT service. It is built using the Discord.NET library.

## Description

This bot connects to a Discord server and listens for messages. When a message mentions the bot, it uses a ChatGPT service to generate a response and sends it back to the channel. The bot logs all received messages and events for debugging purposes.

## Features

- **ChatGPT Integration**: Responds to mentions with AI-generated responses.
- **Coin Flip**: Simulate a coin flip, returning "Heads" or "Tails".
- **Dice Roll**: Roll a die with a default of 20 sides or specify the number of sides.
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: Randomly returns "rock", "paper", or "scissors" when called.
